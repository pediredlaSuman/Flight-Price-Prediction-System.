# Flight Price Prediction Model

## Description
This project builds a flight price prediction model using key features like airline, source, destination, flight duration, and stops. It includes comprehensive data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, datetime conversion, and one-hot encoding, making the data suitable for machine learning models to predict prices accurately.

## Benefits
- **Travelers:** Get accurate flight price predictions for better travel planning.
- **Airlines:** Optimize pricing strategies to increase revenue and customer satisfaction.
- **Decision-making:** Quick and informed decisions for both users and businesses in the competitive airline market.
- **Efficiency:** Streamlines the booking process, enhancing trust in online platforms.

## Implementation
1. **Data collection** with key features such as airline, source, destination, and flight duration.
2. **Pandas** for data manipulation and handling missing values, datetime conversion.
3. **One-hot encoding** applied to convert categorical variables.
4. **Seaborn and Matplotlib** used for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
5. **Scikit-learn** used for building the machine learning model for price prediction.

## Results
The model successfully predicts flight prices based on multiple influencing factors, visualizing data insights through graphs.
