Created a flight price prediction model incorporating key features like airline, source, destination, duration, and stops.Applied comprehensive data preprocessing, addressing missing values, datetime conversion, and one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) with seaborn and matplotlib, discerning price variations across diverse factors.

Real-time:
  - Facilitates accurate prediction of flight prices, assisting travelers in making informed decisions.
  - Enables airlines and travel agencies to adjust pricing strategies dynamically based on various influencing factors.

Implementation:
  - Gather a comprehensive dataset with relevant features such as airline, source, destination, and flight duration.
  - Employ pandas for data manipulation, seaborn and matplotlib for EDA, and scikit-learn for machine learning model development.
  - Use one-hot encoding to convert categorical variables into a format suitable for predictive modeling.
  
Benefits:
  - Enhances user experience by providing accurate flight price predictions, aiding in travel planning.
  - Enables airlines to optimize pricing strategies, leading to increased revenue and customer satisfaction.
  - Facilitates quick decision-making for travelers and businesses in the dynamic and competitive airline industry.
  - Streamlines the booking process, improving efficiency and customer trust in online travel platforms.
